Use HTML markup in this link and turn this form into a Razor Pages functional form
Take the CSS and link it in the Layout so the form gets some nice style :)

//Create the following:
Data Transfer Object (DTO) class to filter in all the information into a C# Object
A DataSource which exposes JSON information.
An IDataAccess and its implementation
Handle the form submission and update the file in the DataSource Project.

The DataSource and the DTOs must be in separate Class Libraries


IDataAccess must have methods to:
fetch all objects
Save a new object and update JSON file
Get one object by ID


When done with all of the above create a Razor Page that will show all the entries found in the JSON file.*@
